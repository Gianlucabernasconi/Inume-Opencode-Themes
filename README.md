## Quick Installation

### User Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gianlucabernasconi/Inume-Opencode-Retro-Themes.git
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/themes
cp Inume-Opencode-Retro-Themes/themes/theme-name.json ~/.config/opencode/themes/
```

Activate it inside OpenCode:

```bash
/theme theme-name
```

Or set it as your default theme in `tui.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json",
  "theme": "theme-name"
}
```

### Project Install

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/themes
cp Inume-Opencode-Retro-Themes/themes/theme-name.json .opencode/themes/
```

OpenCode loads custom themes from `~/.config/opencode/themes/`, `<project-root>/.opencode/themes/`, and `./.opencode/themes/`. Later directories take precedence.
